<p>Desserts are a bit of a problem for us, since one of us is diabetic and the other has gluten allergies.</p>

<p><em>Swerve</em> is a good sugar substitute, but it's pricey.  If you can tolerate some sugar, you can mix it half and half.  Stevia works, too, but you may not like the aftertaste.</p>

<p>You can substitute glute-free flour, but things tend to come out a bit drier than normal.  You can try adding body with xanthan gum or egg whites.  Frankly, we're still experimenting.</p>

<h3>Baking Powder</h3>

<p>The double-acting baking powders have aluminum in the form of <em>sodium aluminum sulfate</em>.  The FDA is ok with it, but we're not (nor are European countries.)  Early studies on alzheimer's indicated a concentration of aluminum in the central region of the brain.  There hasn't been any more on that, but we keep aluminum out of our diet, and that means double-acting baking powders (and uncoated aluminum pans.)</p>

<p>There are several aluminum-free baking powders, but they won't give you that big fluffy rise that the double-acting will.  You can compensate to a certain extent by adding baking soda (1/2t per tablespoon), or, the classic french way, by meranguing egg whites and lightly folding them into the mixture.</p>
