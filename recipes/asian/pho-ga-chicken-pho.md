### Description

I love _pho ga_ (chicken pho), and that's what I usually order at a Vietnamese restaurant.

This one uses an instant pot.  You might be able to use a normal pressure cooker if that's what you have.

This recipe is somewhat modified from the source.  I like to use thighs and I've adjusted the spice content quite a bit.

### Ingredients:

* Small amount of oil, just enough to wet the bottom of the pressure pot (tablespoon or two).
* Medium onion, cut in half. Leave skins and ends intact (on the onion).
* 1-2 inches fresh ginger, sliced in 1/8in slices.
* 1t Coriander seeds.
* 1t Fennel seeds.
* 1 black cardamom pod, crushed.
* 1/2 stick cinnamon.
* 4 cloves
* 5 star anise pods
* 1 1/2t salt
* 1/2t MSG (_Accent_)
* 2T brown, raw, or coconut sugar (I like to use coconut.)
* Scant 1/4C fish sauce
* Small bunch cilantro.
* 3 chicken thighs, skin on.
* 7 ounces rice vermicelli

### Equipment

* Instant pot/pressure pot.
* Pot to boil water for noodles
* Strainers

### Method

Order is important, here.

#### Saute Onion, Ginger, and Spices

1. Set pressure pot on _saute_, at the highest heat setting it will go (mine goes to 360.)
1. Put the onion halves in the pot face-down.
1. Add the ginger slices.
1. Saute until the surfaces of the halves char &mdash; they should eventually be black.
1. As the onion gets dark, add the coriander, fennel, cardomom, cinnamon, cloves and anise pods &ndash; toast them in the bottom of the pan along with the onion and ginger.
1. Turn off the instant pot.
1. Add chicken.

#### Prepare Pressure Cook

1. Add enough water to fill to the 10 cup mark.  (If your pot doesn't have markings, it's about two inches above the chicken thighs.)
1. Add salt, MSG, fish sauce and cilantro.
1. Put lid on instant pot and turn on pressure, high for 30 minutes.

#### Start Noodles

1. When there is 20 minutes left on the pressure pot timer, put on a pot of water for the noodles to boil (don't add noodles, yet!)
1. Turn off the burner &mdash; add noodles and let them soften in the hot water.
1. The noodles should be close to done when the pressure pot times out, but check them &mdash; don't let them get too soft.

#### Release Pressure and Finish

1. When the instant pot times out, quick-release the lid (do this carefully so as not to scald yourself or your cabinets &mdash; unplug and turn the unit so the vent is away from the cabinets.)
1. When the noodles are just underdone, pour them into a strainer.
1. Separate the noodles into two bowls.
1. With a pair of tongs, lift out the chicken thighs, peel off the skin, and use a pair of forks to separate out the meat from the bone in small shreds.  Be careful not to get any 'knuckles'.  Place the skins and bones back in the broth.
1. Place the strainer over the pot you boiled the noodles in and pour the pressure pot contents into the strainer, capturing the broth in the pot below.
1. The strainer content is waste &mdash; throw it away.

#### Serve

1. Ladle the broth over the noodles.
1. Add hoisin sauce, sriracha sauce, lime juice to taste.
1. Top with chopped green onions, thin onion slices, cilantro leaves, thai basil leaves, bean sprouts (if you have them.  It's fine without.)

### Notes

1. The best noodles for this are these from Amazon: [Asian Best Gun Bao](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00ZD8EZA0?ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&th=1)

1. Use the lefover broth to make '[Quickie Pho](/recipes/asian/quickie-pho)'.
