### Description
This is definitely the "Americanized" version of the dish.  If you order it in Italy, you won't see any of the ingredients on the plate &ndash; they're all mixed up in the sauce.

I like lumpy stuff in my pasta sauce, and this dish definitely fits the bill.

The rosemary is the interesting ingredient, here. You need to be a bit careful with the quantity &ndash; it can overpower the garlic!

### Tools

I like to use a cast iron dutch oven or chicken fryer on a stove.  It's heavy, it heats slowly, and retains heat after you turn it off, which is important for mixing all the flavors together in the last stage.

### Ingredients

All of the quantities are suggestion.  Change to taste.

* 2 to 4 links Italian sausage.  If you can't get them from an Italian deli, I've found the Johnsonville _Irish 'O Garlic_ is pretty great.  It slices better if it's frozen
* 1-1/2 - 2 green peppers
* 1 yellow onion
* 5 or 6 cloves of garlic, or to taste
* 2 or 3 sprigs of rosemary
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 medium bunch fresh basil, coarsely chopped
* 1 medium tomato, chop into 1/2 inch cubes.
* Olive oil
* Enough rigatoni for your planned servings - put this on to boil in the beginning as it takes a while to cook to _al dente_.

### Method

1. Slice the Italian sausage into 1/4 to 1/2 inch medallions.
1. Slice the pepper into 1/8 to 1/4 inch strips
1. Throw the sausage disks in the pot to saute in medium heat.  Flip them now and again so they brown evenly on both sides.
1. While the sausage is cooking:
  * Strip all the leaves (needles) off the rosemary sprigs and chop finely.
  * Prep the garlic: I like to slice it super thinly with a sharp knife.  Or you can crush and mince, if you prefer
5.  When the sausage medallions are lightly browned:
1. Sop up the sausage grease with a pair of tongs and paper towels, until the base of the pan is dry.
1. Add some olive oil
1. Add the pepper slices and continue cooking.
1. When the pepper slices start to soften, add the onions.
1. Add a small amount of water to the pot, when it's hot add add the garlic, rosemary, and salt.
1. Cover the pot and let the steam do it's work on the veggies.
1. When the veggies approach doneness, lift the cover off and stir until any remaining water is gone.
1. Turn off the heat, add the tomatoes and basil, stir, cover, and let sit for five to ten minutes.
1. Serve over the pasta - I prefer using pasta bowls or equivalent to hold the sauce.
