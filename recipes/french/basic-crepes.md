### Description

(Note: Pronounced _cr&#x0115;p_, not _cr&#x0101;pe_.)

The great French invention, although pro french chefs will sniff and call it "tourist food".

While true that the many crepe stands that proliferate Parisian streets are visited by tourists, lots of native French are happy to queue up and order a _galette avec oeuf e jambon_ (gallette with egg and ham) or _crepe avec fraise_ (with strawberry jam) or _Nutella_.

They're pricey at the stands &mdash; even in the US they'll cost the equivalent of two or three euros.  Not much trouble and _certainly_ much cheaper to make at home.

This recipe is for the basic breakfast crepe (although not sweet.)  For savory, see the notes below.

### Tools

- Crepe pan, electric _creperie_ (best), or large, flat-bottomed skillet.
- Crepe paddle

The latter may be hard to come by, but if you try to use a spatula or some other such clumsy instrument, you'll fail miserably.

If you're a bit handy with tools, you can easily make one with a couple of sections of wooden dowel of different diameters &mdash; 1/8th inch and 1/4inch, respectively.  Cut the larger diameter to about 3 inches length and the smaller diameter to about 4 - 6 inches. Drill a hole in the larger diameter piece at mid-point big enough to insert the smaller diameter piece into it, and glue it in place to form a 'T'.

I'll try to provide a picture.

### Ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 1/8t salt
- 3T buckwheat flour _(farine de sarrasin)_
  - add enough flour (see below) to make 1 cup
- 1c milk
- 1/4c melted butter

### Method

1. Blend all ingredients in a blender or using a stick blender until batter is smooth
1. Referigerate batter for at least an hour, better overnight.
1. In the morning, re-mix the batter to work out any inconsistencies that may have developed overnight.
1. Heat pan until a few drops of water skitters over the surface &mdash; about the same consistency as pancakes.
1. Lightly butter the pan, using a paper towel to absorb excess butter.
1. Ladle about a quarter cup worth of batter on the pan and then spread with the paddle in a circular pattern until there's an even coat of batter on the pan, about 1/8 inch thick or slightly less.
1. Let sit until the steam lessens and you can get a spatula or flipper underneath and flip it over - the bottom surface should be golden brown.
1. Let sit a few moments on the other side, until it stops sizzling - just a few seconds.
1. Flip onto a plate.
1. Repeat and stack onto the plate with the rest.

### Notes

- For savory crepes, useful for [gallettes](/recipes/french/gallette):
  - Reverse the buckwheat and wheat flour volumes.
  - The buckwheat makes the batter _really_ sticky.  The gallettes should be thicker, anyway, but if too thick, just thin them out with a bit of milk.
- Flour: in the US, cake flour works really well.  In Europe (France), type 45 is the best.
- Gluten free: Rose is gluten intolerant.  You can use gluten free flour, since there is no levening.
  - I find the _Great Value_ (Walmart) brand works really well.
- You can skip the buckwheat flour (for the regular recipe), but the consistency and browning charactistics are much better with it.  Make sure you get buckwheat _flour,_ not pancake mix.
- It'll take a few crepes before you get the hang of the spreading technique and flip timing.
- We usually make a batch and a half for two.
- You can roll up any remainder and refrigerate for later use - wrap with cellophane wrap to keep them from drying out.
