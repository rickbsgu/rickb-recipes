### Description

The first thing I do when I hit Paris is find a restaurant with _moules meniére_, _Leon de Bruxelle_ being the standard in a pinch.

This is not quite _moules meniére_, but it's not bad at all.

Make sure you get a baguette for the sauce!

### Ingredients

* 22 or so mussels per person &mdash; prepare per package instructions.
* 1/2C olive oil
* 1 large onion, minced
* 2T fresh garlic, chopped
* 3 fresh tomatoes
* 3T parsley, chopped
* 1C dry white wine (chardonnay is standby)

### Method

1. Heat oil in a large pot.
2. Add onion and sauté until golden.
3. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.
4. Add remaining ingredients except mussels and bring to a boil.
5. Add mussels and stir gently 7 minutes.
6. Transfer mussels to serving bowls and ladle sauce over each serving

### Notes

* After the first mussel, it's traditional to use its shell as a pair of tongs to pull out the meat from the rest as you go.
* Definitely sop up the unused sauce with baguette chunks.
