### Description

No recipe collection is complete without a basic white sauce recipe.  Which means you can find them anywhere.

Rose and I had the privilege of attending a 2-day class at _Cordon Bleu_ featuring sauces.  While it didn't include a bechamel, it did introduce us to white pepper, wa small addition that really makes this variant stand out from the rest.

### Utensils

* A small, heavy stainless sauce-pan with rounded edges at the bottom works best. 
* A medium-sized whisk.

### Ingredients

* 1C milk, whole or 2% is fine.
* 1 - 1-1/2T flour, depending on how thick you want
* 2 - 3T butter
* salt to taste (1/2 teaspoon or so)
* white pepper to taste (1/2 teaspoon or so)

### Method

1. Melt butter over low heat
2. Add flour and mix with whisk to form a roux (paste)
3. Add milk and whisk
4. Turn up the heat to medium
5. Continue to whisk
6. Don't stop whisking
7. The milk has to come to a boil or the flour won't cook and you'll get a "flour-ey" taste to the salt, but only just.
8. When thickened, add salt  and white pepper to taste.

### Notes

* As with all sauces, you can't let your attention get diverted or it will curdle, boil over, or otherwise make a mess.  Once you've started, stay on it and don't stop whisking until it's done.
* You can use _Wondra_ - if you want.  It works fine and has the benefit that you can add more at the end, if you want to thicken it more without clumping.  Sprinkle lightly.
* I've also used gluten-free flours.  You have to watch them as they'll thicken more than regular flour, so use less.  They also tend to thicken more quickly.
* Use this as a base for other sauces.
