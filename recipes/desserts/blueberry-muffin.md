### Description

From the original poster:

> "These muffins are extra large and yummy with the sugary-cinnamon topping.  I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top edge for a wonderful extra-generously-sized deli-style muffin.  Add extra blueberies too, if you want".

This is a great recipe, see notes below for my own modifications as well as gluten free variant.

### Ingredients

#### Muffins

* 1-1/2c all-purpose flour
* 3/4 cup white sugar
* 1/2t salt
* 2t baking powder
* 1/3 veg (or other neutral) oil
* 1 egg (2 eggs for gluten free)
* 1c blueberries (fresh preferred)

#### Topping

* 1/2c white sugar
* 1/3c all-purpose flour
* 1-1/2t cinnamon
* 1/4c butter

#### Alternate Topping (my preference)

* 2/3c brown sugar
* 1/4c all-purposeflour
* 1/4t cinnamon
* 2T butter

### Method

1. Mix dry ingredients
2. Pour 1/3c oil in a 1c measuring cup
3. Add egg
4. Add enough milk to make 1c (1 2/3c for gluten free)
5. Add to dry mixture and blend in (don't mix too much)
6. Fold in blueberries
7. Ladle into muffin tin cups or dump into greased and floured 8" round baking dish
7. Sprinkle with crumb topping mixture
8. Bake for 20-25 mins @400F (muffin tin) or 45 mins @350 (single baking dish)

### Notes

* I didn't have a muffin tin when I first made this (on an RV), so I made it as one big muffin in an 8inch round deep-walled pan.  It worked great!
* The trick to this is to lower the heat to 350F and bake for more like 45mins.  Your oven may vary.
* Gluten free flours vary considerably.  For the quantities specified, I've used Walmart's _Great 
  Value_ gluten free flour with success.
* For gluten free, the quantity is increased enough that you can use an 8x8 square baking dish.
