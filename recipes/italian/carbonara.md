### Description

> Invented by the Italians, improved by the French, and perfected by Moi!!

This is not a light dish.  Forget diets, calorie counting, cholesterol watching, or anything else considered "healthy".  The goal here is a rich, satisfying meal.

The French are responsible for adding the egg yolk.  You can leave it out, but it really enriches the sauce.  I think it's a great addition.

Traditionally, carbonara does not have mushrooms.  We like mushrooms.  Some French restaurants serve it with mushrooms, some don't.

We like mushrooms.

### Ingredients

* 3-4 cloves garlic
* 2-3T butter
* 1/2t salt, or to taste
* 3/4C heavy cream
* 3 slices thick cut bacon - ham also works
* 1 italian sausage
* 12-14 mushrooms, medium slices

### Method

 1. Put pasta on to boil.  I like thick spaghetti
 2. Slice or crush garlic.
 3. Cut italian sausage in to small pieces and set in heavy skillet on medium heat
 4. Cut bacon to similar size and add to skillet
 5. While the meats are sizzling, in a small saucepan on low heat, melt butter and add garlic.
    * Watch this while you're doing the rest.
    * When the garlic is soft, add cream and continue to heat, stirring occasionally
 6. When the meat mixture is brown, remove and drain.
 7. Wipe skillet out with paper towel and put back on the heat
 8. Add butter to the skillet and sliced mushrooms.
 9. When the mushrooms are cooked, add the drained meat back into the pan with the mushrooms
10. Turn heat off both pans.
11. To serve:
    * Create a nest of pasta on a plate or, better, a pasta bowl
    * Place a serving of the mushroom-meat mixture in the well.
    * Ladle hot sauce on top of the meat - not too much.
    * Crack an egg and separate the whites - the yolk goes on top of the cream
    * Stir the yolk into the dish while the cream is still hot - the cream will thicken as the yolk cooks.

### Notes

1. The key is timing.  Watch the pasta, cream, and skillet contents closely - you want to bring it all together at once.
2. The other key is cooking the meat and mushrooms separately.  You don't want the mushrooms tainted with pork fat.
3. The cream _must_ be hot - close to boiling - to cook the egg yolk.
