### Description

Invented by the Italians, improved by the French, and perfected by Moi!!

This is not a light dish.  Forget diets, calorie counting, cholesterol watching, or anything else considered "healthy".

Made with heavy cream, egg yolks, bacon, and italian sausage, it's scrumptious and filling.  Do it on a designated "bad food day".
