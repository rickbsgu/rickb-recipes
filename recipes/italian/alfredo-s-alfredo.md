### Description

The real thing - no packages, here.

#### Small Story

We had the opportunity to visit Alfredo's in Rome on a visit.

As we were eating, a pair of musicians wandering the restaurant came to our table.  Usually, we're not really up for that sort of thing, but they persisted.  One had a guitar, one a mandolin, and they sang.  We sat politely through a couple of selections, and then ... they  did a number that, to my ears, sounded like what I would expect a siciliano folk song to sound like.  Plaintiff, calling.  Minor key.  It actually brought tears to my eyes.

What could I say?  We were sitting at Alfredo's, in Rome, listening to folk music that came from my Southern Italian heritage.

It was a moment.

#### Differences

We noted a few differences from what we think of as _Alfredo Fettucine_, even as we learned it from the Willams Sonoma book:

1. They bring the pasta, cream/butter and parmesan to the table on a side-cart and mix it, table-side.
2. They use tagliatelle - thinner and lighter than the fettucine we're used to that comes out of a box.
3. The butter-to-cream ratio was definitely butter-heavy.  Not sure I liked that, but you can experiment.

### Ingredients

* 1-2T Butter
* 1/4C Cream (adjust as necessary)
* 1/3C _Freshly_ grated parmesan
* Salt to taste
* Nutmeg (optional)

### Equipment

A pasta fork works well for the final stages.

### Method

1. Put pasta on to boil
2. When the pasta is _almost al-dente,_ remove it from the water and drain.
3. Heat the butter and cream in a shallow skillet on medium heat until the butter is melted and the cream starts to boil.
4. Add salt
5. Add the pasta and mix vigourously, until the pasta absorbs most of the cream and finishes cooking.
6. When most of the cream is absorbed, sprinkle in the grated parmesan, continuing to mix with the fork so the pasta is coated evenly.
7. Finally grate a dusting of nutmeg, if you choose.
8. Serve _immediately_.

### Notes

1. You're not looking for 'saucy', here - the ultimate product should be on the verge of dry if you're doing it right.  The amount of cream is typically just enough to coat the bottom of the skillet.
2. _Don't skip on the parmesan!_  And don't get pre-grated.  The aroma and flavor that comes straight from real parmesan straight off the wheel is what makes the dish.  Get a wedge of the best you can afford, and grate it with a good device - we like to use the micro-planer type grater.
3. Things go quickly once you add the pasta to the mix.  Hold off until any other dishes are close to done (we like to do it with salmon), so everything can come out together.
4. Recite Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford lines together and toast each other with a good chianti - Douglas and Mary were who inspired Alfredo to create the dish on one of their many visits.
