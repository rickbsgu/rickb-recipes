### Description

My main Chinese restaurant dish fave is Kung Pao Chicken, bar none.

I used to live to go to _Pei Wei/PF Chang_ for lunches when I could slip off campus from work.  I really like the _PeiWei_ style - the stir fry ingredients are lightly coated, and they add snap peas, which gives the dish some nice color and crunchiness.

But, a good Kung Pao can set you back $20 at most restaurants - not terrible when you're working, tougher when you are not.

This recipe is much simplified from the source - see the notes at the bottom for further information.

### Ingredients:

This is as a replacement for the _Pei Wei_ version.

#### Stir Fry

* One large or two small chicken breasts
* 4 Scallions
* Handful of snap peas
* 1t Salt
* 1t Onion Powder
* 1/2t Corn starch
* Chinese Peppers
* 2 Cloves garlic
* Equivalent amount of ginger (as the garlic)
* Handful of roasted, skinless peanuts
* Frying oil (peanut, canola, whatever)
* Sesame oil

#### Sauce

* 1t Dark Soy Sauce
* 1T Light Soy Sauce
* 2T Black Vinegar
* 2-3T Dark brown or coconut sugar (I use 3T coconut sugar)
* 1/4c water
* 2t corn starch
* 1-2T Sichuan Dou Ban Jiang

### Equipment

* Wok or large skillet
* Fine mesh strainer

### Method

Order is important, here.

#### 1. Prep chicken

1. Cut the chicken into 1/2 inch pieces (or so) and place in a small bowl.
2. Sprinkle a small amount of salt, onion powder and corn starch on the chicken.
3. Shake the bowl and repeat.
4. Add rice wine
5. Stir and set aside

#### 2. Prep Sauce

1. Mix all of the liquid ingredients into a cup and stir to dissolve the Dou Ban Jiang
2. Pour the mixture into another cup through a fine seive to remove all the Dou Ban Jian husks and beans
3. Add the corn starch and stir
4. Set aside

#### 3. Prep The Other Stir Fry Ingredients

1. Chop the garlic and ginger finely and set aside
2. Cut the white parts of the scallions into 1/2inch pieces and set aside
3. If you're inclined, trim the snap pea ends and remove the spine (I don't - they're tender enough I just eat them whole)

#### Stir Fry

Make sure all the of the ingredients are at hand.  You don't want to be searching for stuff, once the frying starts.

 1. Add 2 tablespoons (or so) of oil to the wok and turn heat on high.
 2. When it's hot (starts to smoke), add the prepped chicken pieces
 3. Let sit until it starts to brown and you can separate the pieces, cleanly
 4. Stir until chicken is lightly browned
 5. Transfer  cooked chicken to another container
 6. Turn heat down to medium, and add a small amount of sesame oil
 7. Add the snap peas and peppers and stir continuously.
 8. When the peas start to brighten add the garlic/ginger mix
 9. Stir continuously, until the garlic and ginger begin to soften - only a minute or so.
10. Add the scallions and continue to stir for another minute.
11. Return the chicken to the wok and continue to stir to heat everything together.
12. Stir the sauce mixture to dissolve any corn starch that may have settled
13. Pour in a small amount of the sauce into the stir fry, continually stirring to coat all of the wok contents
14. Repeat until the entire content is coated to the consistency you want (see notes)
15. Turn off heat, add peanuts and stir them in to coat.
16. Serve.

### Notes

1. It all goes _really_ fast, once you start the stir fry.
2. The amount of heat to integrate is a matter of taste.  You can toss in the peppers whole, or cut them up, use as much or as little as works for you.  You can also try sicuan peppercorns if you want.  They were too much for us.
3. It shouldn't be 'saucy' in the end - you just want to coat the ingredients (but coat them well.)  It's ok if you have sauce left over.
4. Describing the ingredients and process is much more complicated than actually doing the recipe.  It goes more smoothly after you've done it a few times.
5. The Dou Ban Jian paste I got was full of whole beans, husks, and other particulates that I didn't want, hence the straining procedure in the sauce.
6. Don't use _Kikkoman_ soy sauce for cooking.  It's Japanese - you want Chinese soy sauces, preferably both the dark and the light.  If you can't get the dark, just use light.
7. If you want to see or try the full recipe, go to the source listed at the top.  It's pretty involved, but she is wonderful to watch and very informative, as well.
