Garlic.  You can't have too much garlic!!</p>
<p>
My early youth was spent in an italian neighborhood in upstate New York.  I remember the family gatherings &ndash; loud, crowded, and the smell of <em>garlic</em> hanging heavily in the air.</p>
<p>
I don't go to italian restaurants, any more &ndash; especially for pasta dishes.  I find I can do them much better at home.</p>
