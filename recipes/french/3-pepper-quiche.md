### Description

"Real men don't eat quiche," it has been said.

Real men do _make_ quiche, however.  And then we eat them, anyway.  Preferably with a cup of hot, black coffee and a rasher of bacon.

Watch your oven temps - the ones listed are for a _convection_ oven.  A conventional oven may require higher temperature (like 350F) and longer bake times.

### Utensils

* A 9" glass pie pan works really well, with high sides.
* Large bowl
* Large whisk
* Large cast iron skillet is good for sweating the peppers.
* Seive
* Pie crust weights (or beans)

### Ingredients

* 3 large eggs
* 1c heavy cream
* 2 - 3T butter
* 1/3c gruyere cheese, grated
* 1ea medium green, red, and yellow pepper (or orange)
* 1 pie crust (I use Pillsbury's rolled up crust.  It's awesome.)
* 2 medium leeks
* 1/2t salt
* White pepper to taste (about 1t)

### Method

Timing makes things go more efficiently.  See notes.

#### Veggies

1. Cut the peppers into 1/4" strips, longitudinally.
2. Cut strips in half
3. Place in large skillet with butter on low heat.  DON'T LET THEM BROWN!!
4. Stir occasionally.
5. Cut out the white parts of the leeks - that's what you want.  Trim the bottom off, as well.
6. Cut leek whites in half, longitudinally.
7. Slice the halves into 1/8" slices, across the width.
8. Place the leeks in the seive and rinse throughly, stirring with your fingers to separate the layers.
9. When the peppers begin to soften add the leeks and continue to heat and stir until they're soft.

#### Crust

 1. Preheat oven to 325F
 2. Bring the crust to room temperature
 3. Crumple a sheet of parchment paper large enough to underlay the crust
 4. Roll the crust out on the paper, then transfer the paper with the crust to the pie plate
 5. Gently press the crust (and the paper) into the pie plate, working it with your fingers until the crust conforms to the shape of the pan.  Press out any folds and continue to work it until it fits smoothly (as much as you can, anyway)
 6. Trim the parchment paper
 7. Cut another piece of parchment the same size and crumple it up
 8. Lay on top of the crust and fill with pie weights/beans
 9. Trim the top layer of parchment
10. Bake in oven for 20 minutes.
11. While baking, whisk together just the eggs in the large bowl
12. After 20 minutes, pull out the crust and remove the top layer of parchment paper with the weights to expose the crust
13. Give the eggs another whisk and then brush a thin layer of the beaten eggs onto the crust (don't use up too much of the eggs - you need them for the filling)
14. Place in the oven  for another 10 minutes
15. The crust should be golden brown when done

#### Filling

1. After you've brushed the crust with the beaten eggs,
2. Add the cream, gruyere, salt, and white pepper and mix thouroughly.

#### Putting It All Together

1. Transfer the softened veggies to the pie crust
2. Pour the filling over the veggies
3. Press any veggies that are sticking up out of the filling down
4. Place in oven for 30 minutes.

### Notes

* Timing:
  * I start with cutting the peppers and getting them in the pan to sweat early - it can take the better part of an hour to get them soft.
  * While the peppers are sweating, I prep the crust and get it in the oven for the first bake.
  * Then I can cut the leeks at my leisure, and whisk the eggs for the brush.
  * Watching the peppers and adding the leeks at the appropriate time, I monitor the crust and do the second baking with the brushed on eggs
  * After brushing the crust with the eggs and sticking it back in the oven, I can mix the rest of the filling
  * The rest goes pretty easily, since the crust and the veggies are done at about the same time.
* Peppers and leeks can come in all sizes.  Add or subtract quantities as necessary - you don't want the filling to be too sparsely or densely packed.
* Leeks can be _really_ dirty.  Make sure you follow the directions in step 8 in the _Veggies_ section, assiduously.
* If you can't get gruyere (not likely - even Walmart has it in their deli section), you can substitute emmental or swiss - they're pretty close.  I've even tried it with block provolone and it wasn't bad...
* Test the quiche with a knife or toothpick - the times listed are for a convection oven.  A conventional oven may require higher temps and longer times.
* Ideally, there should be a light browning on top of the quiche, when its done.
