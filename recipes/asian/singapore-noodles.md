### Description

Typically, in the buffets, singapore noodles are mostly noodles with just little bits of meat and veggies.  But, if you make them on your own, you can control how much 'lumpy stuff' you want to add.

It's really easy to make, _but_ the hard part is getting the right noodles.  You want the vermicelli, but not the angel hair if you can avoid it.  If you can't avoid it, you can use the angel hair, but it cooks really fast and can clump together if you're not careful.

### Ingredients:

#### Stir Fry

All quanities are approximate.  Use a scale for weights.

* 1.5oz Carrots, julienned
* 2.5oz Bell pepper (any color is fine), sliced into 1/8 inch strips
* 1.5oz Onion, thinly sliced
* 1.5oz Bean sprouts
* 4 Scallions, sliced into 1 inch pieces
* 2 Cloves garlic, sliced thin
* 2.5oz Protein (pork, chicken, tofu)
* 5.0oz Shrimp
* 2 eggs
* 7oz Rice vermicelli
* Frying oil (peanut, canola, whatever)

#### Sauce

* 1T Soy sauce (light chinese, preferably)
* 1T Fish sauce
* 2t Oyster sauce
* 1t Sugar
* 1-2t curry powder (like Madras or whatever you can get)
* 1t tumeric

### Equipment

* Wok or large skillet

### Method

Order is important, here.

1. Boil enough water for noodles &mdash; about 8 cups
1. Turn off the heat and add noodles.  Let noodles soak until flexible, but __not soft__
1. Drain noodles and spread out on a cooling rack

#### 2. Prep Sauce

1. Mix all sauce ingredients into a cup.
1. Set aside

#### Stir Fry

Make sure all the of the ingredients are at hand.  You don't want to be searching for stuff, once the frying starts.

1. Add 2 tablespoons (or so) of oil to the wok and turn heat on high
1. When it's hot (starts to smoke), add protein
1. When browned/crisped to taste (a minute or two) pull to side of wok and add scrambled egg
1. When egg has set, pull to side of wok and add shrimp
1. Stir until shrimp turns pink or looks done (also a minute or two)
1. Transfer contents to another container
1. Add oil to the wok if dry and add carrots
1. Cook until they look done to your taste
1. Add garlic and stir until soft
1. Add pepper and stir for a few seconds
1. Add noodles (you might want to shift to tongs)
1. Add sauce and toss noodles until coated
1. Add scallions and continue to toss until scallions glisten
1. Re-add the protein and stir until well blended
1. Turn off heat and serve


### Notes

1. It all goes _really_ fast, once you start the stir fry.
1. Describing the ingredients and process is much more complicated than actually doing the recipe.  It goes more smoothly after you've done it a few times.
1. Don't use _Kikkoman_ soy sauce for cooking.  It's Japanese - you want light Chinese soy sauce.
1. Keep the wok _hot_, otherwise the noodles will stick.  Move quickly and keep things stirring as you add ingredients.
1. We find the recommended noodle quantity is to much.  Find your own level.
1. Rice noodle labeled "Angel Hair" is too fine.  If you use it, only soak it for a minute and a half to two minutes.  It's pretty hard to keep it from clumping.
1. The recommended noodles are these from Amazon: [Asian Best Gun Bao](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00ZD8EZA0?ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&th=1)
7. If you want to see a video, go to the source listed at the top.  It's pretty involved, but she is wonderful to watch and very informative, as well.
