<p>Desserts are a bit of a problem for us, since one of us is diabetic and the other has gluten allergies.</p>

<p><em>Erythrotol</em> and <em>Monkfruit</em> are better sugar substitutes than <em>sucrolose</em> or <em>aspartame</em>, but they are somewhat pricey.  If you can tolerate some sugar, you can mix it half and half.  <em>Stevia</em> works, too, and is cheap, but you may not like the aftertaste.</p>

<p>You can substitute gluten-free flour, but things tend to come out a bit drier than normal.  You can try adding body with xanthan gum or egg whites.  Frankly, we're still experimenting.</p>

<h3>Baking Powder</h3>

<p><em>All</em> of the double-acting baking powders have aluminum in the form of <em>sodium aluminum sulfate</em>.  The FDA is ok with it, but we're not (nor are European countries.)  Early studies on alzheimer's indicated a concentration of aluminum in the central region of the brain.  There hasn't been any more on that, but we keep aluminum out of our diet, and that means no double-acting baking powders (and uncoated aluminum pans.)</p>

<p>There are several aluminum-free baking powders, but they won't give you that big fluffy rise that the double-acting will. (Some brands say they are aluminum free <em>and</em> double-acting &mdash; <b>they are not!</b>)  You can compensate to a certain extent by adding a bit of extra baking soda (1/2t per tablespoon), or, the classic french way, by meranguing egg whites and lightly folding them into the mixture.</p>
