description: A few thoughts on quantities/technique

### Discussion

I'm very much a "touchy-feely" cook.  I'm constantly tasting, checking consistency, adjusting as I go.

That's a technique/habit I picked up from my Mom.

#### Tastes Vary - Personal Adjustments

If you're a strict recipe follower, you may find the recipes in here a bit frustrating.  While I've tried to provide reasonable quantities, you have to consider them as "suggestions".

individual tastes are just different.  I provide quantities and ingredients that I think works for me - your mileage may vary.

#### A Stint at _Cordon Bleu_

If it is any consolation or even, perhaps, inspirational, my spouse used to be a strict 'by-the-numbers' recipe follower.  She was fond of saying, "If you can read, you can cook!"

And yes, she was frustrated - even derisive - of my cooking technique.

Then she spent a considerable amount of time and money to attend _Cordon Bleu_ in Paris, and quickly learned that nothing is 'by-the-numbers'.

Well, maybe except for pastry.

But, in the _cuisine_ syllabus, it is not so.  An exchange she relates between a student and an instructor at _Cordon Blue_ is illustrative:

> Student: "How long do you let it cook?"
>
> Instructor (with a shrug): "Until it is done..."

#### Post-Script

My spouse is no longer a strictly 'by-the-numbers' cook.

That's somewhat a vindication for my technique, except she's far and beyond my capabilities - she now does things in the kitchen that are much more imaginative and wonderful than I could ever do.
