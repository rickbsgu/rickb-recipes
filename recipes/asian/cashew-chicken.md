### Description

Fairly easy prep, flavorful.

### Ingredients

* 1 to 1-1/2lbs chicken breasts, cut into strips or cubes pieces
* rice wine (not vinegar)
* handful of cashews
* 1/4c water
* 2t cornstarch
* 1/4c hoisin sauce
* 1t soy sauce - light if you can get it
* 1/2t salt
* 1/4t pepper
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1/2 knob fresh ginger
* 8 scallions, cut into 1 inch pieces
* Cooking oil - peanut, canola, vegetable
* Sesame oil
* Green veggies (optional), such as:
  * broccoli
  * snap peas
  * mushrooms

### Method

#### Prep

1. Cut up the chicken and place in a bowl
   1. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, cornstarch, and _splash_ of rice vinegar
   2. Toss until coated and set aside
2. Toast cashews
3. Mix hoisin sauce, soy sauce, water, 2T rice wine and 2t cornstarch in a measuring cup.
   1. Set aside
4. Chop any veggies
   1. If using mushrooms, cut into quarters rather than slices
5. Chop garlic and ginger

#### Cook

 1. Add 2-3T cooking oil to pan/wok and heat on high.
 2. Add chicken, stirring until brown.
 3. Remove chicken, turn heat down
 4. Add more oil, if needed - mix of cooking and sesame oil.
 5. Add veggies, if using:
    1. Broccoli first, as it takes longest to cook.
    2. Snap peas and mushrooms next.
 6. When veggies are almost done, add garlic, ginger.
 7. Add scallions at the end.
 8. Return chicken to wok and continue to stir until chicken reheated.
 9. Stir up the sauce mix and add to pan, stirring constantly.
10. Coat all of the ingredients in the sauce mix.
11. When sauce is thick and all ingredients are coated, turn off heat.
12. Add cashews.
13. Serve over rice, brown or white

#### Notes

1. Per usual, you don't want to be messing with chopping or other prep once the wok is going. Get it all done before-hand.
2. Slicing mushrooms will make them cook down too quickly and you'll lose them in the mix.  Quarters will hold up with the other veggies.
3. Stir and shake the wok constantly.
