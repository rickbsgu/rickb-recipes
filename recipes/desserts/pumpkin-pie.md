### Description

Pumpkin pie is one of those things that I grew up with, and the pies of my
youth had a memorable texture and flavor.  The pies in the stores are gelatinous
messes and don't measure up.

Typically, I've gone to the _Libby's_ can recipe, but that it has seemed a bit bland lately.  I think part of that is they eliminated the allspice.

This recipe adds an egg, reinstates the allspice, and then amps up the spices a bit &ndash; I think it recaptures the pumpkin pies that I remember.

### Ingredients

#### Wet

* 1 15oz can pumpkin (the small one)
* 3 large eggs
* 1 can evaporated milk

#### Dry

* 2/3c sugar
* 1/2t salt
* 4 cloves
* 4-5 berries allspice
* 3/4t ground ginger
* 1-1/2t ground cinnamon
* 1 Pie crust

### Method

Preheat oven to 425F.

#### Pie crust

1. Lay pie crust in a deep 9" pie pan. It will fold in places &ndash; try to get as few folds as possible, and then just mash them down with your fingers to match the thickness.
1. Insure the crust covers the sides.  You can cut part of the crust where it extends above the rim with a sharp knife and use cut-off pieces to patch low spots.
1. Perforate the crust with a fork evenly all through the bottom and around the sides.

#### Filling

1. Grind the cloves and allspice berries finely.
1. Place cloves and allspice, ginger, cinnamon, and sugar in a small bowl. 
1. Beat eggs in a large bowl.
1. Add pumpkin and mix thoroughly.
1. Slowly add dry ingredients to eggs and pumpkin mixture, stirring constantly.
1. Add evaporated milk, slowly, stirring constantly.

#### Assembly and baking

1. Pour filling into the pie shell.
1. Place in center rack of oven.
1. Bake at 425F for 20-25 minutes (See note below for convection oven).
1. Reduce temperature to 350F and bake for another 40-45 minutes

### Notes

- I like to use whole versions of cloves and allspice and grind them in a morter and pestle.  The cloves can be pretty hard, so you have to pound them pretty hard.  If you want to use pre-ground, it would come out to about 1/4 teaspoon each.
- Times are for normal oven.  For a convection oven, I've changed the first period to 15 minutes at 425, and then reduced to 325F and baked for one hour. It's worked really well.
- I use pyrex pie plates.  Other materials may affect baking characteristics.
- Top with whipped cream.
