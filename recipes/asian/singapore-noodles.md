### Description

Typically, in the buffets, singapore noodles are mostly noodles with just little bits of meat and veggies.  But, if you make them on your own, you can control how much 'lumpy stuff' you want to add.

It's really easy to make, _but_ the hard part is getting the right noodles.  You want the vermicelli, but not the angel hair if you can avoid it.  If you can't avoid it, you can use the angel hair, but it cooks really fast and can clump together if you're not careful.

### Ingredients:

#### Stir Fry

All quanities are approximate.  Use a scale for weights.

* 1.5oz Carrots, julienned
* 2.5oz Bell pepper (any color is fine), sliced into 1/8 inch strips
* 1.5oz Onion, thinly sliced
* 1.5oz Bean sprouts
* 4 Scallions, sliced into 1 inch pieces
* 2 Cloves garlic, sliced thin
* 2.5oz Protein (pork, chicken, tofu)
* 5.0oz Shrimp
* 3 eggs
* 7oz Rice vermicelli
* Frying oil (peanut, canola, whatever)

#### Sauce

* 1T Soy sauce (light chinese, preferably)
* 1T Fish sauce
* 2t Oyster sauce
* 1t Sugar
* 1/2t curry powder (like Madras or whatever you can get)
* 1t tumeric

### Equipment

* Wok or large skillet

### Method

Order is important, here.

1. Boil enough water for noodles &mdash; about 8 cups, or so.
1. Turn off the heat and add noodles.  Let noodles soak until flexible, but __not too soft__.
1. Drain noodles and spread out on a cooling rack.

#### 2. Prep Sauce

1. Mix all sauce ingredients into a cup.
1. Set aside

#### Stir Fry

Make sure all the of the ingredients are at hand.  You don't want to be searching for stuff, once the frying starts.

1. Add 2 tablespoons (or so) of oil to the wok and turn heat on high.
1. When it's hot (starts to smoke), add tofu/pork/chicken.
1. When browned/crisped to taste separate into another bowl/dish and drain off oil.
1. Add more oil if necessary and shrimp.
1. Fry shrimp until just done, and pull off with the other protein.
1. Add more oil if necessary and beaten eggs, stirring until they set.
1. Add to the rest of the protein bowl.
1. Reduce heat, to medium.
1. Add more oil if necessary to the wok and add carrots &mdash; stir fry until slightly soft.
1. Add pepper and onion and stir until the onion gets soft and translucent.
1. Add scallions and garlic and continue to toss a few seconds until they start ot soften.
1. Re-add the protein and stir until well blended.
1. Add noodles (you might want to shift to tongs).
1. Add sauce (stir first to mix up the dry ingredients) and toss noodles until coated &mdash; if they're too firm/chewy, add water a little at a time and test until they're the correct consistency. 
1. Turn off heat and serve.


### Notes

1. It all goes _really_ fast, once you start the stir fry &mdash; make sure your ingredients are prepped and in reach.
1. Describing the ingredients and process is much more complicated than actually doing the recipe.  It goes more smoothly after you've done it a few times.
1. Set up ventilation as best you can over your cooking surface &mdash; our smoke detectors tend to go off repeatedly, if we're not careful.  We turn on an overhead ventilation hood fan to max and open a kitchen window.  The smoke lessens after you turn the heat down and move to veggies and get more ingredients in the wok.
1. Madras curry varies wildly in flavor and heat intensity from brand to brand.  This amount is for _Koshy's_ brand, if you can find it.
1. Don't use _Kikkoman_ soy sauce for cooking.  It's Japanese. You want light Chinese soy sauce.
1. Keep the wok _hot_, especially for the protein.  Move quickly and keep things stirring as you add ingredients.
1. I like to suspend a strainer over a smaller bowl to hold the separated protein &mdash; that way the oil can drain off easily and thoroughly.
1. Rice noodles labeled _"Angel Hair"_ are too fine.  If you use them, only soak them for a minute and a half to two minutes.  It's pretty hard to keep them from clumping.
1. The best noodles for this are these from Amazon: [Asian Best Gun Bao](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00ZD8EZA0?ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&th=1)
