### Description

The great French invention, although pro cooks will sniff and call it "tourist food".

While true, the many crepe stands that proliferate Parisian streets are visited by tourists, lots of native French are happy to queue up and order a _galette avec oeuf e jambon_ or _crepe avec fraise_ (strawberry jam) or _Nutella_.

They're pricey at the stands &mdash; even in the US they'll cost the equivalent of two or three euros.  Not much trouble and _certainly_ much cheaper to make at home.

### Tools

- crepe pan, electric _creperie_ (best), or large, flat-bottomed skillet.
- crepe paddle

The latter may be hard to come by, but if you're a bit handy with tools, you can make one with a couple of sections of wooden dowel.  I'll try to provide pictures.

### Ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 1/8t salt
- 3T buckwheat flour _(farine de sarrasin) + enough all-purpose flour to make 1 cup
- 1c milk
- 1/4c melted butter

### Method

1. Blend all ingredients in a blender or using a stick blender until batter is smooth
1. Referigerate batter for at least an hour, better overnight.
1. In the morning, re-mix the batter to work out any inconsistencies that may have developed overnight.
1. Heat pan until a few drops of water skitters over the surface &mdash; about the same consistency as pancakes.
1. Lightly butter the pan, using a paper towel to absorb excess butter.
1. Ladle about a quarter cup worth of batter on the pan and then spread with the paddle in a circular pattern until there's an even coat of batter on the pan, about 1/8 inch thick or slightly less.
1. Let sit until the steam lessens and you can get a spatula or flipper underneath and flip it over - the bottom surface should be golden brown.
1. Let sit a few moments on the other side, until it stops sizzling - just a few seconds.
1. Flip onto a plate.
1. Repeat and stack onto the plate with the rest.

### Notes

- You can skip the buckwheat flour, but it really makes the consistency and browning charactistics much better with it.  Make sure you get buckwheat _flour,_ not pancake mix.
- It'll take a few crepes before you get the hang of the spreading technique and flip timing.
- We usually make a batch and a half for two.
- You can roll up any remainder and refrigerate for later use - wrap with cellophane wrap to keep them from drying out.
