#### Prep

1. Boil some water for the noodles
  1. When it boils, turn it off and add noodles
  1. Watch noodles carefully.

#### Cook
1. Heat up a wok with oil and stir fry protein
  1. I like to do eggs last, but it doesn't matter.
  1. Drain the protein and reserve for later.
1. Lower heat and add broccoli
1. Add a small amount of water to the broccoli, cover and steam for 10-15 minutes, until tender as desired.
1. When broccoli is at desired consistency, uncover and dry out.
1. Add garlic and heat for another minute or so until garlic is soft.

#### Finish
1. Add noodles and reintroduce protein.
1. Add sauce and gently stir from the bottom up until everything is coated.
1. Turn off heat and serve.


### Notes

1. In US restaurants like to use wide noodles.  I like the wide noodles,  but I've had a problem with them sticking together (the brand I used, anyway), so I've reverted to regular pad thai noodles, for now.  I'd rather use the wrong noodle and have better results than fight trying to separate stuck-together wide noodles (In the link above, Palin &ndash; who grew up in Thailand &ndash; says they always made it with regular pad thai noodles.)
1. Watch the noodles &mdash; it can be hard to judge when they're ready.  Better if they're not quite done when you add them to the wok &mdash; you can soften them up with more water.  But, be careful doing that, too - they can get mushy.
1. Also, don't heat too long after adding the sauce.  Ideally, it should be a fairly saucy dish & if you heat to long, it will reduce the sauce and be much thicker.
1. This is the best sauce recipe I've found.  The _Golden Mountain_ sauce has a distinct flavor.  In my opinion, it can't be omitted.
