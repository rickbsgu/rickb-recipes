### Description

_Licorice-ey_ flavored cream sauce for shrimp.  Very french with the fennel bulb and the tarragon.

10 minute prep time (so claimed, but it really does go together pretty quickly once you've gathered everything together.)

### Ingredients

* 2T butter
* 1 fennel bulb, ideally with feathery fronds intact.
* 1/2lb 30-40 count shrimp, shelled and deveined
* Handfull of cherry tomatoes
* 2oz Pernod (or pastis, Sambucca, or ouzo)
* 3T heavy cream
* 2T chopped fresh tarragon, stems removed
* salt and pepper to taste

### Method

 1. Halve, core, and finely dice fennel bulb. Reserve feathery fronds.
 2. In a sauce pan (or medium-sized skillet) add butter and fennel.
 3. Saute for one minute.
 4. Add shrimp and tomatoes.
 5. Saute for one minute more.
 6. Add liquor, let sit for five seconds then flambe.
 7. Douse flame after 10 seconds if it doesn't go out by itself.
 8. Add cream tarragon, salt and pepper.
 9. Reduce for 1-2 minutes, or until sauce is thick and rich
10. Serve over rice, angel hair, or toasted rustic bread.

### Notes

* If you're going to do pasta or rice, make sure you get them started before doing the sauce and shrimp.
* I tend to combine the fennel and the tarragon in a small food processor and chop them up together in step one.
* Flambe is cute - I normally don't.
* I usually use more cream, since I'm typically serving over pasta.  Not too much - you still need to reduce to thicken it up.
