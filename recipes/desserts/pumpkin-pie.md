### Description

Pumpkin pie is one of those things that I grew up with, and the pies of my
youth had a memorable texture and flavor.  The pies in the stores are gelatinous
messes and don't measure up.

Typically, I've gone to the _Libby's_ can recipe, but that hasn't been great, either.

So this recipe is somewhat modified from that, but I think it recaptures the pumpkin
pies that I remember.

### Ingredients

#### Wet

* 1 15oz can pumpkin (the small one)
* 3 large eggs
* 1 can evaporated milk

#### Dry

* 2/3c sugar
* 4 cloves
* 4-5 berries allspice
* 3/4t ground ginger
* 1-1/2t ground cinnamon
* 1 Pie crust

### Method

Preheat oven to 425F.

#### Pie crust

1. Lay pie crust in a deep 9" pie pan.
1. Insure the crust covers the sides.  You can cut part of the crust where it extends and use it to patch low spots.
1. Perforate the crust with a fork evenly all through the bottom and around the sides.

#### Filling

1. Grind the cloves and allspice berries finely.
1. Place cloves and allspice, ginger, cinnamon, and sugar in a small bowl. 
1. Beat eggs in a large bowl.
1. Add pumpkin and mix thoroughly.
1. Slowly add dry ingredients to eggs and pumpkin mixture, stirring constantly.
1. Add evaporated milk, slowly, stirring constantly.

#### Assembly and baking

1. Pour filling into the pie shell.
1. Place in center rack of oven.
1. Bake at 425F for 20-25 minutes.
1. Reduce temperature to 350F and bake for another 40-45 minutes

### Notes

- I like to use whole versions of cloves and allspice and grind them in a morter and pestle.  The cloves can be pretty hard, so you have to pound them pretty hard.  If you want to use pre-ground, it would come out to a little over 1/4 teaspoon.
- I use pyrex pie plates.  Other materials may affect baking characteristics.
- Top with whipped cream.
