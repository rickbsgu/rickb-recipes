### Description

I've held off buying a pressure (or _instant_) pot for some time, not sure if I want another space-taking device in an already overstuffed kitchen.

But, while visiting my little brother in Florida, he served a soup that he made in an instant pot.  It was delicious and hung in my mind, so I decided it was time: I purchased a pot &ndash; a combination pressure and air-fryer &ndash; and had him send me the recipe.

It's a _great_ soup &ndash; the chicken pieces coated in the rub and saut√©ed impart a lot of flavor.

### Ingredients
This recipe is for a 6 quart pot.  Adjust accordingly.

#### For the soup:

- 2 chicken thighs
- 3 large carrots
- 3 large sticks celery
- 1 zucchini
- 1 yellow summer squash
- 1 onion (yellow or white)
- 3 or 4 bay leaves
- 1qt chicken stock
- 1t _Better Than Bullion_

#### For the rub:
- 1t salt
- 1t ground rosemary leaves
- 1t rubbed sage
- 1t dried thyme
- 1/2t pepper

### Method

 1. Mix the rub ingredients
 1. Skin the chicken thighs
 1. Rub the thighs with the mixture and set aside.
 1. Cut all the veggies into 1 inch chunks
 1. When you're done with the veggies, put a small amount of oil in the pot, just enough to cover the bottom, and set to saute on the "Poultry" mode (or equivalent).
 1. Brown the chicken thighs.  They should be mostly cooked when you're done.
 1. Turn off the pot.
 1. Add the veggies.
 1. Add the chicken stock and enough water to just cover the contents.
 1. Stir in the _Better Than Bullion_
 1. Add the bay leaves
 1. Cover and set the pot to the pressure setting on "Poultry" or equivalent.
 1. Set for 20 minutes.
 1. At the end of the cooking cycle, you can release naturally if you have the time, or release instantly if you don't.
 1. Pull out the chicken pieces from the pot and separate the meat with a pair of forks.  Make sure you separate out any cartilage.
 1. Put the meat back into the pot and throw away the bones and cartilage.
 1. Serve

 ### Notes:

 1. The original recipe called for sweet potatoes, but I found they just turned to mush, so they're not here.
 1. I try not to recommend brand names, but the _Better Than Bullion_ is really an exceptional product.  And it really punches up the soup flavor.
 1. The original recipe cooking time was 30 minutes.  Cooking that long reduces the veggies to mush.  I've found 20 minutes cooks the chicken, but leaves the veggies a bit more intact.
