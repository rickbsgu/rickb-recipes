### Description

I got a taste of shrimp and grits while we were travelling through Charleston, West Virginia, where it's considered a signature dish.

This version is with a cajun fire-roasted tomato sauce.

### Ingredients:

#### Shrimp
* 12 Jumbo Shrimp, deveined and peeled

#### Sauce

* 2 links andouille (or polska keilbasa or other sausage), cut into 1/4in to 1/2in pieces
* 1 small green bell pepper, chopped small
* 4T butter
* 2T olive oil
* 1 celery stalk, chopped fine
* 2T minced garlic
* 2T flour
* 2T creole seasoning
* 1 14.5oz can chicken broth
* 1 15oz can diced fire roasted tomatos
* 1/4c heavy cream
* salt and pepper to taste
* parsley for garnish

#### grits

* 2c water or chicken broth
* 1c grits
* 2T butter
* 3/4c white cheese (parmesan, grana padano, white cheddar, or a mixture of any), grated
* 2T heavy cream
* 1T ground peppercorn.

### Equipment

* Large cast iron skillet

### Method

#### Grits

1. In a small saucepan, add grits to boiling water.
1. Reduce heat to _low_ and stir continuously until it is mixed thoroughly in the water.
1. You can do the shrimp and sauce while it's thickening, but don't take your eyes off it too long - it'll stick to the bottom of the pan.
1. When thick (anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes, depending on the type of grits you use), stir in the cheese.
1. Add cream, butter, and pepper to taste.

#### Shrimp

1. Mix oil and butter, melt in large skillet.
1. Saute the shrimp in oil on medium heat, just until browning on both sides.
1. Remove shrimp to another dish.

#### Sauce

1. In the same skillet, heat onions, celery, and pepper in remaining oil on medium heat until soft - don't brown any of the veggies.
1. Add sausage, continuing to stir.
1. Add garlic, continuing to stir.
1. Add flour, and stir until it is incorporated into the oil.
1. Add chicken stock.
1. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, letting the sauce thicken.
1. Season with salt and pepper.

### Serving

* Spoon grits into a plate or pasta bowl.
* Smother with sauce
* Top with shrimp - 6 pieces per serving is about right.


### Notes

* AB's video referenced at the top is a great watch.  Highly recommend.
* Watch the grits, closely - they stick to the pan easily if too hot.
