### Description

If you find yourself heading to the store and buying the little pre-roasted chickens when you can't think of anything else to do for dinner, try this.

It's easy to prep, but it does take 45 minutes to bake.  But, you don't have to do anything other than throw it in the oven and set a timer &ndash; you can pretty much ignore it until the timer beeps.

The meat comes out amazingly tender and juicy, and the skin is amazingly crispy.

### Ingredients

* 4 pieces of chicken &ndash; the source recipe calls for thighs, but it seems to work pretty well for drumsticks, too.
* 1T garlic powder
* 1t salt
* 1t dried oregano

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 425&deg;
1. Trim any excess skin off the chicken pieces.
1. Dry the chicken pieces thoroughly with a paper towel.
1. Mix the dry ingredients together.
1. Rub the chicken pieces with the dry ingredients.
1. Place in a baking dish &ndash; I use a square 8 inch pyrex baking dish.
1. Bake in oven for 45 minutes.

### Notes

1. The key is the chicken really has to be as dry as you can get it.
1. For an awesome side, try the [Six Minute Aglio Olio](/recipes/italian/six-minute-aglio-olio)
