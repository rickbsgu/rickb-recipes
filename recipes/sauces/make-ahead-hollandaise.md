### Description

While the regular [hollandaise sauce recipe](/recipes/sauces/hollandaise) is great, it has some disadvantages:

1. You have to separate eggs.
2. You wind up having whites that you aren't using.
3. It's a bit of a juggle to do while you're doing everything else.

Issues 1 and 2 mean you're going through a _lot_ of eggs.  For our [eggs benedict breakfast for two people](/recipes/breakfasts/eggs-benedict) that's six eggs using the recipes on this site.

I've since researched the idea of using _egg yolk powder_ to make the hollandaise ahead of time.

While somewhat expensive, it saves eggs since you only have to poach the ones that you put on the dish and you don't wind up with whites that you have to figure out what to do with.

This recipe works pretty well, and it's still real hollandaise (not the chemical stuff that comes in a package.)

I've made it with with expensive butter _(Plugra)_ and cheap butter _(Walmart &ndash; Great value)_ and it comes out fine with either.

It is now my goto hollandaise.  See the notes at the end for more information.

### Ingredients

* 8 oz butter (two sticks or one brick, typically &ndash; depending on how it's packaged)
* 30g (6T) egg yolk powder
* 30g (2T) lemon juice
* 3g (1/2t) salt
* 80g (1/4c) water

### Tools

* blender

### Method

1. Melt the butter in a pan (slowly, so it doesn't spit)
2. Put water, lemon juice, salt, and egg yolk powder in the blender
3. Blend the mix until smooth (a short burst should do it)
4. While blending, slowly drizzle the melted butter into the blender.
  - The sauce will emulsify instantly as your blending and pouring.

### Notes

1. The original recipe is specified in weight, hence I put the weight values first.  It's really the better way to measure ingredients.
1. At the time of this writing, eggs are almost 50 cents US each.  Using egg yolk powder really saves the egg usage to what you need.
1. Egg yolk powder is made by spraying egg yolks on to a surface, letting them dry, and then scraping them off the surface.  They're really egg yolks.
1. Some egg yolk powders have sodium phospho-aluminate in it (or some such variant) as an anti-clumping agent.  For the same reason I don't like to use double-acting baking powder, I don't like to use those.
1. Store the unused sauce in a closed container in the refrigerator.
1. To use again, spoon out what you need into a pan and warm _slowly_.  I put it in the pan on low heat and stir it now and again.  As soon as it starts to liquify, I turn off the heat and let the residual heat of the pan liquify/heat it the rest of the way.
1. You can heat it in the microwave at a low level (I've use half-power for 1 minute, stir and do it gain until it's liquified and warm).
1. If you heat it too much or too long, it will absolutely break (it's real hollandaise).
