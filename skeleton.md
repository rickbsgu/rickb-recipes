1. In the small pan, heat 2-3 inches of water to hot, but not boiling.
1. Cut the butter into smallish pieces and put on ice.  Needs to stay cold.
1. Mix the egg yolks and water in the bowl.
1. Place the bowl over the pan.
1. Start beating the mix with a whisk.  __DO NOT__ take your attention off this.  _If_ you have to do something else (for a moment), take the bowl off the pan and return it when you're done.
  * This is a side step
  * This is another side step
6. The mixture will froth up a bit and expand.  This is good.
1. As the mixture just starts to set &ndash; you'll see light folds between the whisk strokes &ndash; but _before_ you can see the bottom of the bowl between whisk strokes), add butter one piece at a time, whisking constantly.
1. Add salt and continue to stir until dissolved.
1. When all of the butter is incorporated and the sauce is smooth, add salt and sprinkle in lemon juice &ndash; taste just until the tang is right.

### Notes
<!---
 | Another ordered list of anything else you want to talk about.
 -->

1. You don't want to heat the yolk mixture, directly (unless you're super-good at controlling heat.) Use the or small saucepan and stainless bowl to control the temperature.
1. You can't let your attention wander for this &ndash; set aside the time so that you can do the sauce and nothing else until it's done.  As you gain experience, you might be able to multi-task.
1. If the mixture gets too hot, lift the bowl off the pan and keep going.  The water in the pan should not be boiling, but it often does when it's capped.  Put the bowl back on if it gets too cool.
1. The sauce will come out remarkably better if you use good butter.  _Plugra_, _KerryGold_ or similar works well.
1. If it breaks, toss in a small piece of ice.  It _might_ fix it.
1. When done, don't try to leave the bowl on the pan to keep the sauce warm &ndash; it will break.  Take it off the pan and return it just before you're ready to serve ro heat it up.
1. You can save the remainder.  To restore it, pull it out of the fridge, reheat gently, stirring constantly and keep a piece of ice on hand if it breaks.  Or stick it in the microwave on a _really_ low setting for 30 seconds and stir like crazy when you pull it out.
1. Required for [Eggs Benedict](/recipes/sauces/eggs-benedict) or Eggs Florentine, but awesome over fish or asparagus or ...
