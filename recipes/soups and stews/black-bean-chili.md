### Description

Everyone has their own chili recipe that they've perfected over time.  Or that they continue to modify over time to "play" somewhat.

Mine is somewhat in the latter persuasion, somewhat of the former.  The base is Carroll Shelby's award-winning version, with my own personal touches and method.

### Equipment

* A small crockpot works well for the burbling stage (and this quantity.)  You can get them just about anywhere for around $10.
* A _really_ large cast iron skillet is good for browning the meat and saute-ing the veggies.

### Ingredients

* 1/2lb or so ground beef.  I use two preformed patties because I like to have the patties available for other things.
* 2 links Italian sausage, skinned.  I use mild, since the spiciness comes from the spices.
* 1 green pepper, cut into 1/4inch slices.  You can cut the slices in half or quarters if you don't want the long slices.
* 1 medium white onion, cut into quarters pole to pole and then cut into 1/4 - 1/2 inch slices.  Dice from there  if you want smaller pieces.
* 3-5 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced or crushed.
* 1t ground cumin (I like to grind whole cumin - it's fresher)
* 1 - 2t salt
* 1 -2 T oregeno - Mexican preferred, but Italian is ok.
* 3 - 5T ground chili - preferably sweet
* 1 eight ounce can tomato sauce
* 1 can black beans

#### Optional

* Beer for liquid (see notes)
* Masa to thicken

### Method

1. Brown the Italian sausage and ground beef together in a large skillet over medium heat.  It should break up into smallish chunks.
2. Sop off the fat with tongs and paper towels.  Replace with 3 or 4 tablespoons of fresh cooking oil.
3. Turn heat to low and add pepper and onion, cover and heat until the onions become translucent and the peppers soften somewhat.  DON'T LET THEM BROWN!!
4. Add garlic and spices and a bit of water, cover and heat a bit longer to let spices blend in and the garlic to become translucent.  DON'T LET THE GARLIC TOAST!!
5. Add tomato sauce, and mix it up well.
6. Transfer to crockpot, add enough water so the liquid is just up with the meat and veggies, cover and set on high.
7. Let it burble on high for an hour or so.
8. After an hour, stir the contents, set the crockpot to low, and let it simmer for 4-6 hours.
9. Before serving, mix in the black beans

### Notes

* Shelby uses beer for the liquid.  It's ok - I find it's a bit too 'yeasty' if I use it for all the liquid.  You can use a bit of beer in step 4 and water for step 6 if you find the same.
* Another method is to sweat the veggies and brown the meats in separate pans.  When the veggies are softened up, drain the fat off the meat and add to the veggies, then continue from step 4.  I've been moving in this direction, lately - I think I like it, but it does add to the number of cooking pans and utensils.
* Be careful when you procure tomato sauce - some ahave other ingredients like  garlic,  oregeno, and basil.  Those can be ok, just examine the label carefully and make sure you know what you're getting.  This recipe assumes plain tomato sauce.  Salt-free is ok - you can add your own salt.
* You can play with other ingredients - some have added a tablespoon or so of sugar, a few chunks of chocolate or cocoa, whatever floats your boat.
* If you need to thicken it up a bit, use a teaspoon or tablespoon of masa at the end.
