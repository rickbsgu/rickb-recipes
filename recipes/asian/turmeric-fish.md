### Description

This goes together fairly quickly &mdash; the biggest hassle is ensuring the fish is dry.

### Ingredients

* 1/2 small red or or green chile
* 2t fish sauce
* 2t lime juice
* 1T sugar
* 2 cloves garlic, minced and divided
* 1/2 inch knob ginger
* 1/2t turmeric
* 3T oil, divided
* 3/4lb cod filet
* fresh dill to taste
* 4 scallions, white parts very thinly sliced lengthwise, green parts cut into 2 inch pieces
* 1/4c roasted peanuts

### Method

1. Place noodles in a dish with _hot_ water &mdash enough to cover the noodles.
1. Set aside.

#### Sauce

1. Mix chile, fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, half of the garlic, and 1/4c cold water in a small bowl.

#### Fish

1. Mix ginger, turmeric, 2T oil and remaining garlic in medium bowl.
1. Add fish and toss to coat.
1. Season w/ salt and pepper
1. Heat 1T oil in medium non-stick skillet.
1. Add fish and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown and just cooked through &mdash; about 4-5 minutes.
1. Add dill and scallion greens, toss a few times, and continue to cook until greens are barely wilted &mdash; about 30 seconds.

#### Noodles
1. Heat a small amount of oil in a wok
1. Add noodles and stir, watching the texture of the noodles.
1. Cook until the noodles start to soften. Add small amounts of water as necessary so they don't dry out.
1. When noodles are slightly soft, add sauce and continue to stir until noodles get complete soft.

Serve the noodles and dish side-by-side in a shallow bowl - a pasta bowl works great.


#### Notes

1. The sauce would work great as a _pad thai_ sauce with the addition of a bit of tamarind.
