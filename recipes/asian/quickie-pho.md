### Description

After making the main [Pho Ga](/recipes/asian/pho-ga) recipe, I always have quite a bit of broth leftover. This is something you can do with it for a quick dinner or lunch for one.

### Ingredients:

* Pho broth &mdash; enough to mostly fill your target bowl.
* Rice vermicelli &mdash; about 3 1/2 ounces.
* Slice or two of cooked ham.
* 1 egg
* 2 scallions

### Equipment

* Pot to boil water for noodles
* Pan to heat broth

### Method

#### Noodles

1. Put pot of water on burner to boil for noodles.
1. When it boils, turn off the burner and add noodles.
1. Let noodles soften in the hot water and watch carefully.  You want them just soft enough, but not too soft.
1. Strain them when at the right consistency.

#### The Rest

1. Put broth in pan and heat to almost boiling.  It should be steaming.
1. Beat the egg in a bowl.
1. Cut scallions in 1/8 inch slices.
1. Julienne the ham and sizzle the strips in a non-stick frypan over medium heat with a touch of oil until brown.
1. Remove the ham strips from the pan to a paper towel to drain.
1. Return the pan to the burner and reduce heat to medium-low.
1. Pour the egg into the pan and swirl it around to thin it out.  In a 10 inch pan, it should go edge to edge.
1. When the egg is cooked, use a spatula and roll it from the edges until it is fully rolled up.
1. Remove the roll to a cutting board and cut into one-half inch slices.

#### Serving

1. Place the noodles in the bowl.
1. Add ham strips, rolled up egg, and scallions to the bowl.
1. Pour broth over contents to desired level.
1. Top with your favorite pho toppings.  See the main [Pho ga](/recipes/asian/pho-ga) recipe for serving suggestions.

### Notes

1. The best noodles for this are these from Amazon: [Asian Best Gun Bao](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00ZD8EZA0?ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&th=1)
1. The rolled up egg is just the way I like to do it.  Obviously you can do the egg however you want, substitute something else, or just eliminate it altogether.
1. Simularly, feel free to add or substitute other ingredients to taste.
