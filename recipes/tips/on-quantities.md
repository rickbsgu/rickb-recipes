description: A few thoughts on quantities/technique

---
### Discussion

I'm very much a "touchy-feely" cook.  I'm constantly tasting, checking consistency, adjusting as I go.

That's a technique/habit I picked up from my Mom.

#### Tastes Vary - Personal Adjustments

If you're a strict recipe follower, you may find the recipes in here a bit frustrating.  While I've tried to provide reasonable quantities, you have to consider them as "suggestions".

Individual tastes are just different.  I provide quantities and ingredients that I think works for me - your mileage may vary.

#### Find Your Own Taste

Use these recipes as a starting point.  Experiment and find out the quantities (and perhaps cook times and other factors) that work for you.

Cooking is a dynamic activity &ndash; I'm still tweaking recipes that I've made for years.  It's a continual learning process for me, and it will be for you.  If it isn't, you're not doing it right.

Share thoughts with me in the comments section.  If you come up with something better, I'm not above updating the recipe with something that works better.

Cheers,
