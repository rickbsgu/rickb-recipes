### Description

Here are three methods of poaching eggs, progressing in difficulty.

Whichever you use, the goal is to have firm whites and runny yolks. It's more a matter of timing and heat control than anything else.

### Tools

<dl>
<dt>Egg poacher</dt>
<dd>This comes in a set with a shallow pan, a set of holders, a frame to hold them in the pan, and a lid.</dd>
<dt>Silicone egg cups</dt>
<dd>Individual cups made of silicone &ndash; you float them in a wide, shallow pan.  A lid for the pan is necessary, also.</dd>
<dt>Skillet/shallow frying pan.</dt>
<dd>The tool your grandmother used.  Also needs a lid.</dd>

### Ingredients

* eggs
* butter
* water
* vinegar (for the skillet method)

### Methods

For all, you want the water to be just on the edge of a simmer, no hotter.  Too hot, and it will boil and egg foam will get into the water and the results won't be good.  It also makes timing more difficult.

#### Egg Poacher

1. Add enough water to cover the bottom to a depth that won't touch the bottom of the egg cups.  Leave a quarter inch or so.
1. Grease the cups with butter, using your fingers.
1. Turn the heat on medium.
1. When the water is hot (but not boiling), add the eggs to the cups and cover.
1. When the whites set (you can test by jiggling the pan a little and observing the consistency of the whites), take the lid off and rotate the cups by their handles 90 degrees (careful - they're hot.)  They'll be cool to the touch in just a few seconds.
1. Remove and serve by overturning the cups (or scoop them out if you want the pretty side up.)

#### Silicone Cups

1. Select a pan that can float the number of cups you want to use.
1. Add enough water to float the cups &ndash; remember they will sink somewhat when you add the eggs.
1. Turn the heat on medium.
1. Grease the cups with butter, using your fingers and float them in the water.
1. When the water is hot (but not boiling), add the eggs to the cups and cover.
1. When the whites are set (you can jiggle the cups to observe the consistency of the whites), pull the cups out.
1. To serve, use a spoon to break the contact and ease the egg out of the cup.

#### Skillet

1. Grease the skillet with butter, using your fingers.
1. Add enough water that will cover the broken eggs.
1. Add a few drops of vineger &ndash; this will help keep the egg together.
1. When the water is hot (but not boiling), carefully drop the eggs into the water, one at a time.
1. The eggs will float (if not, they're bad).  Every now and again, pull the spoon some of the hot water over the eggs so the yolk skins turn milky.
1. When the whites are set, use a slotted spoon or spatula to lift the eggs out of the pan.

### Notes

1. Practice makes perfect.
1. You need to pay attention, or the yolks will cook.  You don't want hard poached eggs.
