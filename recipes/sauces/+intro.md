I used to be a devotee of package sauces. They were easy – just peel open a package, dump it into a pan, add some water or milk, heat and stir.</p>
<p>
This was before I learned how to make real hollandaise, with real egg yolks and lemon juice.</p>
<p>
It was a transformative experience. Looking at the formerly loved package ingredients, there was no eggs or lemon juice to be found. Same thing with the alfredo packets we used to crave – no cream, no parmesan, none of that.  Just a list of chemicals.</p>
