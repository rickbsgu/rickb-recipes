### Description

A savory crepe, an egg, ham, and gruyere make this classic french lunch.  If you get it at a crepe stand, the yolk is likely to be broken and fried in with the egg.

This version came from a booklet in a crepe maker I bought in Paris.

### Ingredients

* Savory [crepes](/recipes/french/crepes)
* Egg
* Ham, sliced into strips
* Gruyere cheese (emmentaler or swiss works just as well)

### Method

1. If making new crepes:
	* Do the following after flipping the crepe
1. If using pre-made crepes:
	* Place crepe in a hot, flat pan - hot enough to cook an egg
1. Break an egg into the center of the crepe
1. Let the egg cook
1. Add ham strips to the egg
1. Grate a tablespoon or so of gruyere over the egg.
1. When the white is cooked, flip the edges of the crepe.
1. Optionally, ladle some [bechamel](/recipes/sauces/bechamel) over it.
