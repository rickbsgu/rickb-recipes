### Description

A classic breakfast to brighten any morning.

### Tools

* Egg-poacher, or a small skillet.  See [Poaching Eggs](/recipes/tips/poaching-eggs) for some tips.

### Ingredients

* [Hollandaise Sauce](/recipes/sauces/hollandaise)
* eggs
* ham (or spinach, for _Eggs Florentine_)
* [Hash Browns](/recipes/sides/hash-browns)
* English muffins

### Method

1. Prep the hollandaise, hash browns, ham, and toast the english muffins in whatever order is efficient for you (see notes)
1. Place toasted english muffins on plate
1. Layer with ham slice or spinach
1. Place one poached egg on each assembly
1. Smother with hollandaise
1. Add hash browns
1. Serve _immediately_

### Notes
1. The biggest challenge in this dish is timing, complicated somewhat if you're going to make coffee (who wants eggs benedict without coffee?), and only experience will teach you how to get the timing right.  The goal is for everthing to come out at once and warm.
1. I usually start by getting everything ready &dash; eggs, ham, hollandaise ingredients, potatoes out and shredded, shallots cut, and all within immediate reach.  You don't want to be searching for an ingredient while everything is cooking.
1. I do the hollandaise first, and take it off the _bain-marie_, turning off the heat. It will cool, slightly, but you don't want to keep it on the simmering water &nbsp; it will break.  It's easy to warm back up, when you're ready to assemble.
1. Next, I get everything else started, starting with the hash browns.
1. When starting to assemble, I put the hollandaise back on the still warm pan, keeping an eye on it and stirring frequently.
1. When it all comes together, it's pretty sublime.
