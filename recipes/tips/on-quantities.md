### Discussion

I'm very much a "touchy-feely" cook.  I'm constantly tasting, checking consistency, adjusting as I go.

That's a technique/habit I picked up from my Mom.

If you're a strict recipe follower, you may find the recipes in here a bit frustrating.  While I've tried to provide reasonable quantities, individual tastes are just different.  I provide what I think works for me - you mileage may vary.

If it is any consolation or even inspiration, my spouse used to be a strict 'by-the-numbers' recipe follower, and yes, she was frustrated - even derisive - of my cooking technique.

Then she went to _Cordon Bleu_ in Paris, and quickly learned that nothing is 'by-the-numbers'.  Well, maybe except for pastry.

An exchange between a student and an instructor at _Cordon Blue_ is illustrative:

Student: "How long do you let it cook?"

Instructor (with a shrug): "Until it is done..."

As a post-script, my spouse is no longer strictly 'by-the-numbers', and now does things in the kitchen that are much more imaginative and wonderful than I could ever do.
