### Description

I was spending the winter in the mexican fishing village of San Carlos, sitting in my RV, when I heard a knock on the door.

I opened it to find a smallish man and his maybe 10 year old daughter standing in front.  He was holding a bag and she was holding a bowl and some utensils.

"You want shrimp?" He asked, holding up the bag.  "Fresh caught off my boat, this morning."

"Absolutely!!", I said, and paid him for a half kilo (I was only one person.)

They set to work, immediately, peeling and deveining the shrimp, right there at my doorstep.  When done, he handed me the bag of the shrimp, I paid him, and contemplated what I was going to do with it.

Something fresh, something tropical. Something yummy...

The picture is the result - the actual shrimp from that day sizzling on my RV stove.

### Ingredients

* 1dz shrimp
* 4T Butter (About a half a stick)
* 4 cloves of garlic
* 3T lime juice, or to taste
* Salt to taste
* Vermicelli/spaghetti

### Method

1. Start water boiling for the pasta
2. Crush or thinly slice garlic
3. Melt butter in small skillet over low-medium heat
4. Add garlic and saute over low until the garlic softens
5. Add salt and lime juice.
6. Add the shrimp last, and let it simmer just until the shrimp curls and turns white, turning every now and again to coat both sides of the shrimp pieces.
7. Serve over bed of pasta

### Notes

1. Vermicelli cooks much more quickly than normal spaghetti - watch it while you're doing the rest.
2. You really have to watch the heat in the butter and garlic mixture - too hot and everything will start to brown.  Keep it low.
