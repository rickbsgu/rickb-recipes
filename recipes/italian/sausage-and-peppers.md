### Description
This is definitely the "Americanized" version of the dish.  If you order it in Italy, you won't see any of the ingredients on the plate &ndash; they're all mixed up in the sauce.

I like lumpy stuff in my pasta sauce, and this dish is definitely lumpy!!

The rosemary is the interesting ingredient, here. You need to be a bit careful with the quantity &ndash; it can overpower the garlic!

### Tools

To saute the lumpy ingredients, I like to use a cast iron dutch oven or chicken fryer on a stove.  It's heavy, it heats slowly, and retains heat after you turn it off, which is important for mixing all the flavors together in the last stage.

For the pasta, a standard pasta pot is fine.

### Ingredients

All of the quantities are suggestions.  Change to taste.

* 2 to 4 links Italian sausage.  If you can't get them from an Italian deli, I've found the Johnsonville _Irish 'O Garlic_ is pretty great.  It slices better if it's frozen
* 1-1/2 - 2 green peppers
* 1 yellow onion
* 5 or 6 cloves of garlic, or to taste
* 2 or 3 sprigs of rosemary
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 medium bunch fresh basil, coarsely chopped
* 1 medium tomato, chop into 1/2 inch cubes.
* Olive oil
* Enough pasta for two servings.

### Method

Start the pasta before doing anything else &mdash; it takes the longest to cook.

#### Prep

1. Slice the Italian sausage into 1/4 to 1/2 inch medallions.
1. Slice the pepper into 1/8 to 1/4 inch strips
1. Same for the onion.
1. Strip all the leaves (needles) off the rosemary sprigs and chop finely.
1. Prep the garlic: I like to slice it super thinly with a sharp knife.  Or you can crush and mince, if you prefer.

#### Veggies

1. Add a small amount of olive oil to the saute pan and set burner to medium or medium low heat.
1. Add the pepper slices &mdash; they take the longest to cook.
1. When the pepper slices start to soften, add the onions.
1. Cover the pot and let the steam do it's work on the veggies.
  - This can take a while.  Stir every now and again and add a _tiny_ bit of water if the mix starts to dry out or you see browning.
1. Add the garlic, rosemary, and salt.
1. When the veggies approach doneness, lift the cover off and stir until any remaining water is gone.

#### Sausage

1. Start this after you've started the veggies.
1. Throw the sausage disks in the saute pan in medium heat with a bit of olive oil.  Flip them now and again so they brown evenly on both sides.
1. When the sausage medallions are lightly browned, separate them out onto a paper towel or drain in a seive over a bowl.

#### Finishing

1. Add the browned sausage to the veggies.
1. Turn off the heat, add the tomatoes and basil, stir, cover, and let sit for five to ten minutes.
1. Serve over the pasta - I prefer using pasta bowls or equivalent to hold the sauce.

### Notes:

- Personally, I think _rigatoni_ is the only suitable pasta &mdash; it's big enough to hold against the veggies and sausage lumpies.

- It takes a surprisingly long time to soften the peppers and onions.  Longer than it will take to brown the sausage slices.  Plan accordingly.
