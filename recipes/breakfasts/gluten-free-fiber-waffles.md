### Description

Once upon a time, I used to think _Eggo_ frozen waffles were the bomb.

Hoboy...

The problem with most waffle recipes is a) they're not gluten free, and b) they're all white flour and sugar.  A sure recipe for slowing up the lower abdominal action.

The 'secret' ingredient in these is _buckwheat_ flour.  You can read more about it in the notes, below, but that's what imparts the fiber content.

### Tools

If using a non-aluminum-based baking powder, you pretty much have to use a flipper waffle iron.  See the note on baking-powders, below.

We've found the double waffle makers (that flip) speed up the process quite a bit.

### Ingredients

* 2/3C Gluten free flour
* 1/3C Oat flour
* 1/3C Buckwheat flour
* 1T Sugar – brown or coconut works nicely
* 1t Baking powder – we like to use the aluminum-free varieties
* Dash salt
* 2 Extra large eggs
* 2-3T Oil – we like to use coconut oil
* Enough milk to make a medium batter
* Spray oil – again, we like to use coconut

### Method

#### Basic waffles

1. Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl or large cup.
2. Crack in the eggs.
3. Add enough milk to make a medium batter.
4. Turn on the waffle iron and let it heat up.
5. If the coconut oil is solid, melt it into a small pan or steel measuring cup and add it to the batter.

* Don't let it get too hot, or it will cook the batter it comes into contact with as you add it.

1. Let the batter sit a bit for a few minutes while the waffle iron is heating up.
2. If needed, thin the batter with milk until it's at a medium consistency.
3. Spray the iron plates with oil and pour the batter until it spreads evenly.
4. Lift the waffles when the iron indicates they're ready.

#### Pancakes

The basic mix works with pancakes with some modification:

1. Reduce the oil by half.
2. Use just one egg.
3. Add a half teaspoon of baking _soda_

#### Gluten Variation

It mostly works for regular flour-based.  Try the following adjustments:

1. Use just one egg
2. Use a 3/4 to a full cup of regular flour

### Notes

Lots, here...

1. Makes 3+ waffles.
2. I find I have to mix pretty vigorously.  Some recipes call for leaving lumps in the batter, but getting pockets of unmixed flours in the waffles isn't my idea of a good experience.
3. To that end, I use a large clear measuring cup so I can make sure the dry ingredients are pulled off the sides.  Spin it around as you mix and scrape the bottom well.  Too many times, I've poured out the batter only to realized there are huge clumps of unmixed dry ingredients stuck to the sides or bottom.
4. I use a lexan camping knife to mix, to avoid scratching the glass mixing container.
5. Note I don't turn the waffle iron on until the end of step four.  The reason is that the batter takes a while to thicken, completely (or at least acceptably.)  If it gets too thick between waffles, add a bit of milk to thin it back out.
6. Baking powder – I'm liable to write a whole essay on baking powder, but, in essence all of the _double-acting_ powders have aluminum in the ingredients (as aluminum-oxide).  The FDA proclaims it safe, but we don't think so – we won't use them.  Note in France and most of Europe, you can't get aluminum-based baking powders. What this translates to in the method is that you _have_ to use a flipper waffle iron, or they won't rise – they'll just be pathetic half-risen disks in the iron.  Flip them.  The double-flipper type makes things go more quickly.
7. Coconut oil – While the FDA is perfectly fine with aluminum in baking powder, they're gonzo down on coconut oil.  It all depends on where you are on the saturated fat/cholesteral balance argument.  We figure the polynesian societies seem to be pretty healthy and happy as a whole, so we use it.  Substitute something else if it disagrees with your sensibilities.
8. Buckwheat flour – A lot of folks think buckwheat flour is a derivative of wheat.  Sensible, since the name contains 'wheat'.  It's actually the seed of a flower.  Very popular in Russia, can be hard to get, here.  Look in health food stores or, last resort, Amazon...
