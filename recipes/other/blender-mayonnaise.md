### Description

Make this and you'll never go back to store-bought, again.

### Ingredients

#### Stage I

* 1 extra large or 2 small eggs
* 1/2t dry mustard
* 1t salt
* dash tobasco sauce
* dash bitters
* 2t sugar (maybe 3 if you want it a bit sweeter)
* 1/4C olive oil

#### Stage II

* 1C light oil (veg, peanut, canola)
* 3T lemon juice

### Method

1. Add Stage I ingredients to a blender or small food processor and blend on high until a good, white emulsion forms.
1. Keep the blender running in the following sequence:
  * drizzle in 1/2 of the light oil
  * Drizzle in the lemon juice
  * Drizzle in the remaining oil.

### Notes

1. Be careful with the bitters quantity - just a drop or two are all you need.
1. You may have to stop and start the blender as the emulsion thickens (to re-engage the mixture in the blender blades.)
1. If you can't get a large enough egg, use two smaller ones - otherwise it may not set up.
1. It should go without saying this needs constant refrigeration once it's made.  The raw egg is invitation to all sorts of nasties.
