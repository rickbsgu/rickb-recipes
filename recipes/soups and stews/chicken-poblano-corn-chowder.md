### Description

I had to spend some time on contract in Houston, TX.

The building I was working in had a cafeteria and one of the staples was a chicken-poblano corn chowder. It really became my favorite.

This is the best approximation of that recipe I could find.

### Ingredients

- 3-6 slices bacon
- 1/2 medium yellow onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 cans corn
- 1 small russet potato, peeled
- 2 chicken breasts
- 1t ground cumin
- 1/2t smoked paprika
- 1/4t chili powder
- 1-1/2c chicken broth
- 1-2 poblano peppers
- 1c milk
- 2oz cream cheese, melted
- 1/3c salsa verde
- 1/2c cilantro, chopped

### Method

 1. Prep the poblanos by roasting over a flame (I use a barbecue) until the skins are black, then place in a paper bag for 15-20 minutes.  After that, they should peel easily.  Split and remove the seeds and chop.
 1. In large pot, cook bacon until crispy.
 1. Remove bacon and chop for topping.
 1. Add onion to pot and cook until fragrant - about 5 minutes.
 1. Stir in garlic, cumin, paprika, chili powder, pinch of salt and pepper.
 1. Cook 5-10 minutes until very fragrant.
 1. Add corn, potato, chicken and half the poblanos.
 1. Stir in broth.
 1. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes &ndash; until chicken is cooked through.
 1. Pull chicken out and shred with a couple of forks.
 1. Transfer 3/4 of the chowder to a blender and blend until mostly smooth
 1. Return to pot, along with chicken.
 1. Stir in remaining poblano, milk, cream cheese and salsa verde.
 1. Simmer another 10 minutes.


 ### Notes:

 1. I tried different kinds of potatoes, including yukon. Forget it &ndash; russet works the best.
 1. Instead of raw chicken, you can get a little roasted chicken and cut out the breasts.  Add it in last.
 1. Original recipe called for adding grated cheese.  Not my thing.
 1. This is a half recipe of the original.
