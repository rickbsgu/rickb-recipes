### Description

This is actually an amalgam of two recipes from the _Emeril's Pressure Airfryer_ booklet that came with the device.

The sauce is amazing, the ribs are amazing.

You'll never go out for ribs, again.

### Tools

* Pressure pot
* Air fryer
* Reducing pan (wide skillet works fine)

### Ingredients

* 1c prepared barbecue sauce
* 1/4c bourbon
* 1t smoked paprika
* 1T dark brown sugar
* 1T maple syrup
* 1t salt
* 1/2t ground pepper
* 1 rack baby-back ribs

### Method

 1. Mix all of the ingredients (except the ribs) together.
 2. Cut the ribs in pieces that will fit in the pressure pot.
 3. Smother the ribs with the sauce mix - move the ribs around so that the sauce coats them as much as possible.
 4. Put the pressure lid on the pot and set for pork, 30 minutes.
 5. When done, release the pressure and pull the ribs out to a holding dish.
 6. Pour the sauce into the reducing pan and set on medium-high heat to reduce the sauce.  When you can see the bottom of the pan with strokes of a spoon, it's thick enough.
 7. Place however many ribs will fit on the air-fryer rack such that they don't overlap (you may have to do this in batches.)
 8. Turn on the air-fryer to 375 and fry for 4 minutes.
 9. Flip the ribs to other side and to the same for 3 minutes
10. Serve with sauce.

### Notes:

1. We like to use _Stubbs_ smokey bbq sauce.  Besides having no HFCS, the smokiness gives the sauce a dark flavor we like.
2. Air fry times may vary.  The original recipe called for 5 minutes on each side, but that turned out too dark for our taste.
